# currency-convertor

Description:
This is a Currency Converter program in C++, which allows users to convert amounts from one currency to another using a menu-driven system. The program supports conversions between the following currencies:

INR (Indian Rupee)
EURO
USD (US Dollar)
DIRHAM
POUND (British Pound Sterling)

‚öôÔ∏è Features:
‚úÖ Menu-driven interface.
‚úÖ Converts currencies based on user input.
‚úÖ Supports multiple currency conversion choices.
‚úÖ Displays appropriate conversion rates.
‚úÖ Option to exit the program safely.

üñ•Ô∏è How It Works:
The user is presented with a main menu with 6 options:

INR
EURO
USD
DIRHAM
POUND
Exit

Based on the selected currency, the user enters:

The amount they want to convert.

The target currency to which they want to convert.

The program uses a switch-case structure to calculate and display the converted amount according to the exchange rates coded.

The program will keep running in a while loop until the user chooses the "Exit" option.

üö® Important Notes:
The program uses integer data type (int) for amounts and results. For more accurate conversions (especially with decimals), float or double should be used instead.

The currency exchange rates are hardcoded and may not reflect real-time market values.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Run:
Copy the code into a C++ compiler (e.g., Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, or any online compiler).

Compile and Run the program.
